#  Q3 — Recursive Heap Reconstruction and Sort

You are given a program that performs Heap Sort using a recursive `heapify` function.

The program is expected to sort the array in ascending order.

---

## Given Array

9 4 7 1 3 6 2

---

## Expected Output

Sorted Array:
1 2 3 4 6 7 9

---

## Rules

- Do NOT rewrite the algorithm.
- Only debug the logic.
- Focus on recursive heapify behavior and index calculations.
- Understand how heap is built from array.
