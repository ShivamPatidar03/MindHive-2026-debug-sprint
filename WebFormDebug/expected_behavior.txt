After fixing all bugs:

1. Proper styling and border box should appear in center.
2. Fade-in animation should work when page loads.
3. Responsive layout should work on small screens.
4. Form should NOT reload the page.
5. If any field is empty → "All fields are required!"
6. If age < 18 → "Age must be 18 or above"
7. If all valid → "Registration Successful!"
