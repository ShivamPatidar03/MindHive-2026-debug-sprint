# Q4 — Student Record Manager (Dictionary Debugging)

A dictionary stores student records with:

- Roll number as key
- Name and list of marks as values

The program should:

1. Add a new mark to a student.
2. Calculate the average marks of each student.
3. Print the name of the topper.

## Expected Output

After adding 99 marks to Riya (roll 102),

Topper: Riya

## Rules

- Debug dictionary manipulation and logic.
- Be careful with list updates and average calculation.
