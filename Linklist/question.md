#  Q2 — Selective Node Compression in a Singly Linked Structure

You are given a singly linked list.

A pointer is provided to a node in the linked list (not the last node).  
You must remove that node from the list **without accessing the head pointer inside the function**.

---

## Linked List in Program

11 -> 22 -> 33 -> 44 -> 55


Pointer is given to the node with value **33**.

---

## Expected Output

Modified List:
11 22 44 55


---

## Important Constraints

- Do NOT rewrite the whole program.
- Only debug the existing logic.
- Understand how memory and pointers work in linked lists.
- Be careful: improper deletion may cause runtime errors.
